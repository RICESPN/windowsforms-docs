# ImageSlides

ImageSlides is a dedicative property for adding and displaying images in the Carousel control, and it also provides several customization options.
{% highlight C# %}


this.carousel1.ImageSlides = true;
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight C# %}


Me.carousel1.ImageSlides = True
{% endhighlight %}


## Adding Images to the Carousel Control

You can add images to the Carousel control only when the ImageSlides property is true. You can populate images in three different ways:

* Through a collection named ImageListCollection. 
* Through image lists.
* Can directly assign an image list to the control. It will populate the control with the images stored in the image list.
* Through file path. 
* Passing the address of a folder will fetch the images from the location and will arrange them in the control.
