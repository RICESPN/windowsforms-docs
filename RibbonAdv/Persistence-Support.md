#  Persistence Support

RibbonControlAdv comes with persistence support. Using this we can restore the saved state of the ribbon control.

#### Persistence works for the following.

* The items in the QuickAccessToolBar that are added through the "Customize Quick Access ToolBar" can be persisted.
* Items added through the context menu that appears while clicking the dropdown arrow to the right of the QuickAccessToolBar can be persisted.
* The collapsed / expanded / floating state of the RibbonPanel can be persisted.
* The position of the QuickAccessToolBar, either below or above the ribbon panel can be persisted.
