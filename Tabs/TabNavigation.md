# TabNavigation

TabControlAdv provides an easy way to navigate through tabs. Setting TabPrimitives (previously, NavigationControl) allows the users to move to the next or previous tab / page and easily traverse to the first / last tab.

TabPrimitives are more flexible, which provides aCloseButton to close tabs and a DropDown that pops-up with a list of all the available TabPages from which the user can choose from.

The Visible property must be set to True to display the tabprimitives added to the control.

SwitchPagesForDialogKeys property available for the TabControlAdv specifies if the control should switch tabpages on pressing Ctrl+Tab or Ctrl+Shift+Tab.

The TabPrimitiveHost property allows to customize the navigation and close buttons by defining it through the TabPrimitives Property Collection. The tabprimitives can be added and each primitive can be assigned with the type to be used, which includes primitives to traverse to the First / Previous / Next / LastTab, Next / PreviousPage and Close / DropDown options.
