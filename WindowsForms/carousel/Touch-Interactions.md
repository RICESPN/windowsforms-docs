# Touch interactions

The Carousel control will respond to default touch interactions that substitute the standard mouse operations. Additionally, the pan, flick, pinch, and stretch operations are supported.

* Pan and flick: Initiates moving the items.
* Pinch and stretch: Increases and decreases the perspective view of the items within the Carousel control.
