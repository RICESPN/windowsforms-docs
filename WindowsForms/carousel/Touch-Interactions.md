# Touch Interactions in Windows Forms Carousel

The Carousel control will respond to default touch interactions that substitute the standard mouse operations. Additionally, the pan, flick, pinch, and stretch operations are supported.

* Pan and flick: Initiates moving the items.
* Pinch and stretch: Increases and decreases the perspective view of the items within the Carousel control.
