# Perspective in Windows Forms Carousel

The [Perspective](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.Carousel.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Tools_Carousel_Perspective) property is used to increase or decrease the size of the elliptical view of the control. It accepts float values, so the users can enlarge or shrink the elliptical view with respect to small values too.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}


this.carousel1.Perspective = 4f;

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight VB %}


Me.carousel1.Perspective = 4f;
{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}
