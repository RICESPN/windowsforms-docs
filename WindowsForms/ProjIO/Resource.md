# Resource

Resources class can be used to create resources and add them to Projects. However, creating resources do not assign them to tasks. One has to explicitly assign the resources to tasks using Assignment class (4.4).Using the Resources class, one can create, add, and modify resources to projects. It can also be used to retrieve resource information.

## Adding Resources to a Project

Resources property exposed by Project class represents the list of all the Resource objects in a project. This property can be used to add resources.

The following code snippet illustrates adding resources to a project.

{% highlight c# %}
// Creating an instance of the Project
Project project = new Project();
// Creating resource
Resource resource = new Resource();
resource.Name = "Resource1";
// Adding resource to project
project.Resources.Add(resource);

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vbnet %}
'Creating an instance of the Project
Dim project As Project = New Project()
' Creating resource
Dim resource As Resource = New Resource()
resource.Name = "Resource1"
' Adding resource to Project
project.Resources.Add(resource)

{% endhighlight %}

## Writing Resources to a Project

Resources property exposed by Project class represents the list of all the Resource objects in a project. This property can be used to update resources in a project.

The following code shows how to write resources to a project.

{% highlight c# %}



// Creating an instance of the Project

Project project = new Project();



// Creating resource

Resource resource = new Resource();

resource.Name = "Resource1";



// Adding resource to project

project.Resources.Add(resource);



// Calculating Resource IDs and UIDs

project.CalculateResourceIDs();



// Saving the project

project.Save("Project With Resources.xml");

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vbnet %}

' Creating an instance of the Project

Dim project As Project = New Project()



' Creating resource

Dim resource As Resource = New Resource()

resource.Name = "Resource1"



' Adding resource to Project

project.Resources.Add(resource)



' Calculating Resource IDs and UIDs

project.CalculateResourceIDs()



' Saving the project

project.Save(@"D:\Project With Resources.xml")

{% endhighlight %}
