## Adding Assignments to a Project

Assignments are used to bind the task and resources. Project class exposes Assignments collection that represents the list of all the Assignment objects in a project. This property can be used to add assignment. 

The code below shows adding assignments to a project:

{% highlight c# %}



// Creating an instance of the Project

Project project = new Project();



// Creating a task

Task task = new Task();

task.Name = "Task1";



// Adding the task to project

project.RootTask.Children.Add(task);



// Calculating Task ID

project.CalculateTaskIDs();



// Creating a resource

Resource resource = new Resource();

resource.Name = "Resource1";



// Adding resource to project

project.Resources.Add(resource)



// Calculating Resource ID

project.CalculateResourceIDs()



// Creating an instance of Assignment

Assignment assignment = new Assignment();

assignment.UID = 1;



// Assigning resource to task

assignment.Task = task;

assignment.Resource = resource;



// Adding resource to project

project.Resources.Add(resource);

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vbnet %}

' Creating an instance of Project

Dim project As Project = New Project()



' Creating an instance of Task

Dim task As Task = New Task()

task.Name = "Task1"



' Adding the task to project

project.RootTask.Children.Add(task)



' Calculating Task ID

project.CalculateTaskIDs()



' Creating an instance of Resource

Dim resource As Resource = New Resource()

resource.Name = "Resource1"



' Adding resource to project

project.Resources.Add(resource)



' Calculating Resource ID

project.CalculateResourceIDs()



' Creating an instance of Assignment

Dim assignment As Assignment = New Assignment()

assignment.UID = 1



' Assigning tasks and resource to assignment

assignment.Task = task

assignment.Resource = resource



' Adding an assignment to a project

project.Assignments.Add(assignment)

{% endhighlight %}

The project created using the above code will look as shown in the following Microsoft Project screenshot.
