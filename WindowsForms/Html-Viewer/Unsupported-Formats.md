# Unsupported formats

The [HTMLUI](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.HTMLUI.HTMLUIControl.html) control is a classic control that allows you to load basic html or htm pages.
 
Unlike web browsers, the following cannot be loaded into web pages,
 
 * Images
 * Complex objects
 
N> So, the html or htm files with complex objects will not be loaded in `HTMLUI` control.
