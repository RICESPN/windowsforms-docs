# Detachable Command Bar

The [`CommandBar`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.CommandBar.html) instance can be added to the menu bar and can be set to detach from the parent menu bar.

## Adding command bar via designer

The command bar can be added via the `DetachedCommandBars` selection from the smart tags options. The below image shows the command bar is added to the menu via the designer settings.

## Adding command bar via code

The command bar instance should be created with required settings and added to the `DetachedCommandBars` collection property. The below code snippet shows the command bar is added to the menu control with top docked position.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

this.commandBar1 = new Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.CommandBar();
this.commandBar1.DockState = Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.CommandBarDockState.Top;
this.commandBar1.Name = "commandBar1";
this.commandbar1.Text = "Command bar1";

this.mainFrameBarManager1.DetachedCommandBars.Add(this.commandBar1);

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight VB %}

Dim commandBar1 as New Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.CommandBar()
Me.commandBar1.DockState = Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.CommandBarDockState.Top
Me.commandBar1.Name = "commandBar1"
Me.commandbar1.Text = "Command bar1"

Me.mainFrameBarManager1.DetachedCommandBars.Add(Me.commandBar1);

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}
