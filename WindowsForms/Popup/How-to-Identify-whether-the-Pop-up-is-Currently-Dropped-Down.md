# How to Identify whether the Pop-up is Currently Dropped Down

The boolean method [IsShowing](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupControlContainer.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_PopupControlContainer_IsShowing) of PopupControlContainer returns whether the popup is currently dropped down or not.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

this.popupControlContainer1.IsShowing();

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb %}

Me.popupControlContainer1.IsShowing()

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
