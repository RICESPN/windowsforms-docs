# Freezing Headers

The PivotGrid for Windows Forms provides built-in support for freezing column and row headers. This is achieved by setting FreezeHeaders property of PivotGrid to True. This feature also enables scrolling through the value cells.


{% highlight c# %}

// To Freeze Grid Headers.
this.PivotGridControl1.FreezeHeaders = true;

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vbnet %}

' To Freeze Grid Headers.
Me.PivotGridControl1.FreezeHeaders = True

{% endhighlight %}
