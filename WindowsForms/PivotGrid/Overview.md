## Introduction to Essential PivotGrid Windows Forms

Essential PivotGrid for Windows Forms is a powerful cell-oriented, extensible grid control. It simulates the pivot table feature of Excel. The PivotGrid, as the name implies, pivots data to organize the data in a cross-tabulated form. The major advantage with a pivot grid is that you can extract the desired information from a large list within seconds. Along with presenting the data, a pivot grid also enables you to summarize and group data.
