# Overview

The PivotGrid control is a powerful cell-oriented, extensible grid control that simulates the pivot table feature of Excel. The PivotGrid, as the name implies, pivots data to be organized in a cross-tabulated form. The major advantage of PivotGrid is that you can extract the desired information from a large list within seconds. Along with presenting the data, the PivotGrid also enables you to summarize and group the data.
