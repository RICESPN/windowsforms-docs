# Selecting Multiple Dates

This control allows you to select multiple dates, by setting the `AllowMultipleSelection` property to true. The following code example illustrates this.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

// Setting to Allow Multiple Selection

{% endhighlight  %}

{% highlight VB %}

' Setting to Allow Multiple Selection

this.SfCalendar1.AllowMultipleSelection = True

{% endhighlight  %}

{% endtabs %}
