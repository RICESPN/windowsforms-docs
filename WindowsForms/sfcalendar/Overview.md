# Overview

The `SfCalendar` is a control that allows you to select a date from the calendar and various customization options for the calendar. This provides multiple views of the month, year, decade, and century, so that dates can be selected easily. The `SfCalendar` supports multiple selection and complete customization option for the control.

## Key features

* **Different views**: Supports for month, year, decade, and century views to quickly select dates.

* **Date-range support**: Provides maximum and minimum date support to prevent users from selecting dates within a specified range.

* **Globalization and localization**: Supports for localized first day of the week, localized static text, and day names based on the culture.

* **Special dates**: Supports for highlighting special dates with icons and descriptions.

* **Blackout dates**: Supports for blocking certain dates from selection and user interaction. Separate styles can be applied to blackout dates. 

* **Accessibility**: Touch, keyboard, and mouse support to make applications available to a wide variety of users.

* **Testing**: Provides QTP add-in that contains custom libraries, which helps [QTP](https://help.syncfusion.com/windowsforms/testing/uft/supported-controls-and-methods#sfcalendar) to recognize SfCalendar.
