# How to modify HubTile image transition direction in runtime?

You can set HubTile [SlideTransition](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.HubTile.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Tools_HubTile_SlideTransition) property to achieve this.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %} 
// Sets Image transition direction as RightToLeft
this.HubTile1.SlideTransition = TransitionDirection.RightToLeft;
// Sets Image transition direction as LeftToRight
this.HubTile1.SlideTransition = TransitionDirection.LeftToRight;
// Sets Image transition direction as TopToBottom
this.HubTile1.SlideTransition = TransitionDirection.TopToBottom;
// Sets Image transition direction as BottomToTop
this.HubTile1.SlideTransition= TransitionDirection.BottomToTop;
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight VB %}
‘Sets Image transition direction as RightToLeft
Me.HubTile1.SlideTransition = TransitionDirection.RightToLeft
‘Sets Image transition direction as LeftToRight
Me.HubTile1.SlideTransition = TransitionDirection.LeftToRight
‘Sets Image transition direction as TopToBottom
Me.HubTile1.SlideTransition = TransitionDirection.TopToBottom
‘Sets Image transition direction as BottomToTop
Me.HubTile1.SlideTransition= TransitionDirection.BottomToTop
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
