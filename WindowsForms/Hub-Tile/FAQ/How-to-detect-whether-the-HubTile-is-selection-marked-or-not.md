# How to detect whether the HubTile is selection marked or not?

You can achieve it by using HubTile [IsSelectionMarked](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.HubTile.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Tools_HubTile_IsSelectionMarked) property.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %} 
/// Sets whether selection is marked over HubTile
this.HubTile1.IsSelectionMarked = true;
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight VB %} 
â€˜Sets whether selection is marked over HubTile
Me.HubTile1.IsSelectionMarked = true
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
