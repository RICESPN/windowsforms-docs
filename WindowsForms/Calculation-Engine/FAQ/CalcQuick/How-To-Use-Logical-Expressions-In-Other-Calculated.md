# How To Use Logical Expressions In Other Calculated Expressions?

Logical expressions return a True or False value. If you use a logical expression as part of a calculation, then, 

* A True is replaced with 1.
* A False is replaced with 0 as the whole expression is evaluated.

This allows you to easily write and compute formulas that involve logical conditions.

Consider the following expression:

([Cost] &lt; 100) * 1 + ([Cost] &gt;= 100) * ([Cost] &lt; 200) * 3 + ([Cost] &gt;= 200) * ([Cost] &lt; 300) * 5 + ([Cost &gt; 300) * 7

Depending upon the value of cost, this expression returns 1, 3, 5 or 7. This is an example of using a linear combination of logical expressions that times other values. 

N> The logical conditions are mutually exclusive, but, when taken as a whole, cover all possible values of cost. It has the effect of assigning a unique value depending upon the input value.
