### Digitally Sign the new PDF document

A digital signature is an electronic signature that is used to authenticate the identity of the sender of a message or the signer of a document, and to ensure that the original content of the message or document is unchanged. It stores information about the signee and the state of the document at the moment of signing.

Digital signatures are easily transportable, cannot be imitated by someone else, and can be automatically time-stamped. It has the ability to ensure that once the original signed message is received, the sender cannot easily repudiate it later.

Standard Signature

PdfCertificateÂ class is used to get the certificates from disk or another device such as PFX file. The PFX file type is an encrypted security file that stores secure certificates that are used to authenticate a PDF document. One needs a password to access these files. The PFX files are supported with private keys.

PdfSignature class has methods and properties that allow setting the signature information such as reason, location information, bounds where the signature has to be placed, and contact information.

### Author Signature

By default, documents are signed with standard signature types.Â CertificatedÂ property of PdfSignature is used to create authorâs signature. When signed with this type of signature, any modification after signing is detected, and hence do not support added multiple signatures.





_Note: This implementation of certification will only work with Acrobat 7 and higher versions._

## Timestamp in Digital signature

Essential PDF supports addition of timestamp in digital signatures. The date and time on which the document is signed can be added as part of the signature. Timestamps are easier to verify when they are associated with timestamp authorityâs trusted certificate.  It also helps establish exactly when the document was signed and reduces the chances of an invalid signature. The timestamp can be obtained from a third-party timestamp authority or from the certificate authority that issued the digital ID.

Timestamps appear in the signature field and in the Signature Properties dialog box. When the timestamp is included, the certificate appears in the Date or Time tab of the Signature Properties dialog box. When no timestamp is added, then the signature field displays the local time of the computer at the moment of signing.

To apply timestamp using Essential PDF, the TimeStampServer property of the PdfSignature class has to be used. The parameters for the TimeStampMethod are the URI of digital server, username, and password.

The following code illustrates the method for adding timestamp in the digital signature.

//Creates a new PDF document.

PdfDocument document = new PdfDocument();

//Adds a new page.

PdfPage page = document.Pages.Add();

PdfGraphics graphics = page.Graphics;

//Creates a certificate instance from PFX file with private key.

PdfCertificate pdfCert = new PdfCertificate(@"PDF.pfx", "syncfusion");

//Creates a digital signature.

PdfSignature signature = new PdfSignature(page, pdfCert, "Signature");

//Sets an image for signature field

PdfBitmap bmp = new PdfBitmap(@"syncfusion_logo.gif");

//Adds time stamp using the server URI and credentials.

signature.TimeStampServer = new TimeStampServer(new Uri("http://digistamp.syncfusion.com"), "user", "123456");

//Sets signature info.

signature.Bounds = new RectangleF(new PointF(0, 0), bmp.PhysicalDimension);

signature.ContactInfo = "johndoe@owned.us";

signature.LocationInfo = "Honolulu, Hawaii";

signature.Reason = "I am author of this document.";

//Draws the signature image.

//Saves and closes the document.
