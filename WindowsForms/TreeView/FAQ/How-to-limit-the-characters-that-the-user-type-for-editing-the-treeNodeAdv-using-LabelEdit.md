This can be done using the below code snippet.

{% highlight c# %}



//It can be done using the following code snippet in the NodeEditorValidateString event to restrict a user from

//entering characters beyond a limit in a Label Editing.

//If the length of the node label is less than or equal 5,the editing continues or else it is canceled.



private void treeViewAdv1_NodeEditorValidateString(object sender, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TreeNodeAdvCancelableEditEventArgs e)

{

    if (e.Label.Length <= 5)

        e.ContinueEditing = true;

    else

        e.Cancel = true;

}

{% endhighlight %}
