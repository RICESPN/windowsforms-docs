# How to Know whether the Image on the Left Side/Right Side of the Node's Text was Clicked

This can be done using the below code snippet.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

//The user could use the Left Image of a node as a clickable area to use

// it as a button associated with that particular tree node
private void treeViewAdv1_MouseUp(object sender, System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs e)
{
    TreeNodeAdv node = this.treeViewAdv1.SelectedNode;
    Point image = new Point(node.TextAndImageBounds.X, node.TextAndImageBounds.Y);
    Size imgSize = new Size(this.imageList1.ImageSize.Width, this.imageList1.ImageSize.Height);
    Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(image, imgSize);
    Point click = new Point(e.X, e.Y);
    if (rect.Contains(click) == true)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Clicked on " + node.Text + "'s left image");
    }
}

//The user could use the Right Image of a node as a clickable area to use

// it as a button associated with that particular tree node
private void treeViewAdv1_MouseUp(object sender, System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs e)
{
    TreeNodeAdv node = this.treeViewAdv1.SelectedNode;
    Point image = new Point(node.RightImagesX, node.TextBounds.Y);
    Size imgSize = new Size(this.imageList1.ImageSize.Width, this.imageList1.ImageSize.Height);
    Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(image imgSize);
    Point click = new Point(e.X, e.Y);
    if (rect.Contains(click) == true)
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Clicked on " + node.Text + "'s right image");
        Console.WriteLine("Clicked on " + node.Text + "'s right image");
    }
}
