# How to Place UserControl in a Header Cell

To have User Control in GridGroupingControl, GridGenericCellModel and GridGenericCellRenderer classes must be derived and User Control designed must be made as a CellModel in the GridGroupingControl using these derived classes.

The following are the steps that need to be followed to do this.

Step 1: The UserControl form is added to the project and the required controls are dropped into it.

Step 2: The GridGenericCellModel and GridGenericCellRenderer classes are derived and the UserControl is drawn accordingly to fit into the required cell header.

 
{% highlight c# %}



 public class CustomControlCellRenderer: GridGenericControlCellRenderer

{

      Control host = null;

      public CustomControlCellRenderer(GridControlBase grid, GridCellModelBase cellModel)

      : base(grid, cellModel)

      {

           SupportsFocusControl = true;

      }

      protected override void OnDraw(Graphics g, Rectangle clientRectangle, int rowIndex, int colIndex, GridStyleInfo style)

      {

           if (host == null)

           {

               host = new Control();

               Grid.Controls.Add(host);

           }

           Button c = CustomControlCellModel.CustomControl;

           FixControlParent(c);

           c.Bounds = clientRectangle;

           c.Refresh();

      }

}
{% endhighlight  %}
{% highlight vb %}






Public Class CustomControlCellRenderer Inherits GridGenericControlCellRenderer

     Private host As Control = Nothing

     Public Sub New(ByVal grid As GridControlBase, ByVal cellModel As GridCellModelBase)

          MyBase.New(grid, cellModel)

          SupportsFocusControl = true

     End Sub

     Protected Overrides Sub OnDraw(ByVal g As Graphics, ByVal clientRectangle As Rectangle, ByVal rowIndex As Integer, ByVal colIndex As Integer, ByVal style As GridStyleInfo)

            If (host = Nothing) Then

               host = New Control

               Grid.Controls.Add(host)

            End If

            Dim c As Button = CustomControlCellModel.CustomControl

            FixControlParent(c)

            c.Bounds = clientRectangle

            c.Refresh

      End Sub

End Class

{% endhighlight  %}

Step 3: A new CellType is created by adding the instance of derived generic cell model class into the GridGroupingControl's CellModels.

 
{% highlight c# %}



CustomControlCellModel.CustomControl = new Button();

this.gridGroupingControl1.Table.TableModel.CellModels.Add("UserControl",new CustomControlCellModel(this.gridGroupingControl1.TableModel));

{% endhighlight  %}
{% highlight vb %}





CustomControlCellModel.CustomControl = New Button

Me.gridGroupingControl1.Table.TableModel.CellModels.Add("UserControl", New CustomControlCellModel(Me.gridGroupingControl1.TableModel))
{% endhighlight  %}
