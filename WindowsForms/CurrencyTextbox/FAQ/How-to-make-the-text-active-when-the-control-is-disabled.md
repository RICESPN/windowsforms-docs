# How to make the text active when the control is disabled

When the control is set to disabled, we could not make any changes in it. But we can make the text active by setting DrawActiveWhenDisabledÂ to True.


<table>
<tr>
<td>
CurrencyTextBox Property</td><td>
Description</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
DrawActiveWhenDisabled</td><td>
Specifies whether the text should be drawn active even when the control is disabled. Enabled property must be set to False.</td></tr>
</table>


The following figure illustrates this.
