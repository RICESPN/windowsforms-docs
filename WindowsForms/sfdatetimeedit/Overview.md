# Overview

The `SfDateTimeEdit` is a control that allows you to edit the `DateTime` in the text or mask format with the support of minimum and maximum value validation, watermark, and globalization. It provides flexible options to display the date-time according to the required format.

## Key features

* **Editing mode**: Supports default text editing and mask mode that helps to restrict the date input in formatted values based on a date-time pattern.

* **Date-range support**: Supports maximum and minimum dates to prevent users from setting a date or time within a specified range.

* **Globalization**: Supports different date-time formats and patterns based on cultures.

* **Date validation**: Supports date validation and error messages due to invalid dates or when date range constraints are met.

* **Accessibility**: Touch, keyboard, and mouse support to make applications available to a wide variety of users.

* **Watermark**: Supports to display watermark text when a selected date is null.

* **Testing**: Provides QTP add-in that contains custom libraries, which helps [QTP](https://help.syncfusion.com/windowsforms/testing/uft/supported-controls-and-methods#sfdatetimeedit) to recognize SfDateTimeEdit.
