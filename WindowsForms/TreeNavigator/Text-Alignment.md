# Text Alignment

This property is used to set the Text Alignment for the TreeMenuItem. There are three alignments, Left, Right, and Center.

The following code examples allow you to set the alignment for the text in the TreeMenuItem.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

this.treeNavigator.TextAlign = TextAlignment.Left;
this.treeNavigator.TextAlign = TextAlignment.Right;
this.treeNavigator.TextAlign = TextAlignment.Center;

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vb %}

Me.TreeNavigator1.TextAlign = TextAlignment.Center
Me.TreeNavigator1.TextAlign = TextAlignment.Left
Me.TreeNavigator1.TextAlign = TextAlignment.Right

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
