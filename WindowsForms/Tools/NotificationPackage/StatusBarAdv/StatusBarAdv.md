# StatusBarAdv

The StatusBarAdv is an advanced StatusBar control that can display StatusBarPanels with enhanced backgrounds and appearances. The StatusBarAdv control can be dragged and dropped from the toolbox onto a form during design time. Users can then drag and drop controls onto the StatusBarAdv control.

Below image shows a StatusBarAdv with controls added to it.
