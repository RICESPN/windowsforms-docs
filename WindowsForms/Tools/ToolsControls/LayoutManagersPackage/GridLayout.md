# GridLayout

GridLayout is a Layout Manager that allows us to arrange the Child controls as in a grid containing rows and columns. Deriving from the Layout Manager base, the GridLayout inherits all the functionality that the Layout Manager type exposes. In its simplest form, this Layout Manager can be used to automatically arrange the Child components in one or more rows, as illustrated below.
