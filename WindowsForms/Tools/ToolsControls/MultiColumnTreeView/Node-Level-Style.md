# Node Level Style

Setting a Common Style for all the Nodes in a Level

TreeView lets you add node level styles using the BaseStyles Collection Editor. By default this style will be applied to all the nodes in the Level1 for NodeLevel1 style, Level2 for NodeLevel2 style and so on.

You can apply this style to any of the node by using TreeNodeAdv.BaseStyle property for a particular node. Refer to Style Settings table in Node Specific Style.
