# Background Color for Office2010 Form

The background of the Office2010 form can be same as the color scheme applied to the form by setting the UseOffice2010SchemeBackColor property to true to make this effective.


{% highlight c# %}

this.UseOffice2010SchemeBackColor = true;

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vbnet %}

Me.UseOffice2010SchemeBackColor = True

{% endhighlight %}
