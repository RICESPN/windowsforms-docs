# Detached ControlBars

ControlBars inEssential Tools XP Menus framework enables application developers to add dockable / floatable controls to their form's toolbar layout. A common example of a ControlBar is the task pane window found in the Microsoft Office 2003 product suite. 

A ControlBar is a full-featured docking container that can host any control and be docked along the border of the host form or floated as a top-level window. ControlBars, however, differ from traditional docking windows by adopting the characteristic layout behavior of a toolbar rather than that of a classic dockable control.
