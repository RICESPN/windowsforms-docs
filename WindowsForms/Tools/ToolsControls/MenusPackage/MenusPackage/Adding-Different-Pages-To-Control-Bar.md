# Adding Different Pages To Control Bar

## Adding and Removing ControlBars 

The MainFrameBarManager's Add Detached ControlBar design-time verb, available through the Properties window, facilitates the addition of ControlBars to the design form. The XP Menus design-time is fully WYSIWYG and the bar layout can be designed by simply dragging and docking or floating each ControlBar at the desired location. Upon saving the design form, the ControlBar state information is serialized by the BarManager as a part of the form's resource file along with the rest of the menu/toolbar layout.

Follow the steps below to add different pages to the control bar.

* Now add XPToolbar to the control bar.
* Add panel to the control bar.
* Add CardLayout over the panel to add different pages.

While dropping out CardLayout onto the panel, the layout designer window will open, asking whether to make panel1 as container control. Click 'Yes' and continue.
