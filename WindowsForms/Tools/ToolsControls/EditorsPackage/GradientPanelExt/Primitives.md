# Primitives

One of the most sophisticated features provided by the GradientPanelExt is its ability to include primitives in the borders. 

The primitives that can be included in the GradientPanelExt are,

* Collapse Primitive - Facilitates expand and collapse option for the GradientPanelExt, with image provisions.
* Image Primitive - Images can be placed along any of the panel borders with gradient background.
* Text Primitive - Text can be included in the GradientPanelExt's borders.
* Host Primitive - Any Windows Forms or custom .NET Control can be placed along the panel borders.

The primitives for the GradientPanelExt can be included using the GradientPanelExt PrimitiveCollection Editor, which can be opened using the primitives property.

The primitive type to be included should be chosen from the Types of Primitives available in the GradientPanelExt Collection Editor, and added to the control. The properties for the primitive can be set in the property grid available at the right side.
