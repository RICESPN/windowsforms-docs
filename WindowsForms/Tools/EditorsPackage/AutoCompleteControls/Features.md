# Features

AutoComplete expands strings that have been partially entered in an edit control into complete strings based on a list of previously specified strings. It has following features.

* Easy to use designer support - Enables users to drag and drop an Auto Complete control to a form and set an extender property on the target control easily without a single piece of code.
* You can implement Microsoft Internet Explorer style auto completion with ease using the Auto Complete control.
* Multiple target controls can use the same Auto Complete control and data source. 
* It provides Auto Complete support to Text Box, ComboBox and user controls that embeds an edit control. 
* It can be bound to [DataSource](/windowsforms/Tools/EditorsPackage/AutoComplete-Controls/DataSource).
* AutoComplete functionality can also be provided for RichTextBox control.
* It is possible to format the text in a standard TextBox control that uses an AutoComplete component based on the data source of the AutoComplete.
* We can hide the close button, gripper and column header in the AutoComplete DropDown. See [Header, Close Button and Gripper](/windowsforms/Tools/EditorsPackage/AutoComplete-Controls/AutoComplete-Popup.html#header-close-button-and-gripper) to know more.
* We can set width for AutoComplete DropDown.
* We can add [multiple columns](/windowsforms/Tools/EditorsPackage/AutoComplete-Controls/Multiple-Columns) for AutoComplete DropDown.
* It supports serialization of history items to the Windows Registry, Isolated Storage or the File System.
* We can also do custom matching i.e, we can override the default matching of the current content of the target edit control.
