{% highlight c# %}

this.gradientPanelExt1.Animated = true;

this.gradientPanelExt1.AnimationDelay = 11;

this.gradientPanelExt1.AnimationSpeed = 2;







this.gradientPanelExt1.Animated = True

this.gradientPanelExt1.AnimationDelay = 11

this.gradientPanelExt1.AnimationSpeed = 2
{% endhighlight  %}
