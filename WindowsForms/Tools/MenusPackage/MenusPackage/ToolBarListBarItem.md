# ToolBarListBarItem

A ToolbarListBarItem is a ListBarItem that expands during runtime to automatically show the list of toolbars currently used in the application. The user can click on this list to show / hide the toolbars. A ToolBarListBarItem can be added to a ParentBarItem by a simple drag-and-drop similar to other bar items.
