## Office2007Form Color Scheme Settings

Office2007Forms now have the ability to apply or not to apply AeroTheme on forms with a glassy effect. This can be done by ApplyAeroTheme property, setting its value either to True or False.

AeroTheme support is available for Office2007Form when used in Vista machine. Earlier ColorSchemes cannot be applied to Office2007Form when AeroTheme was enabled. Now ColorSchemes can be applied by disabling AeroTheme on Office2007Form.

The following code illustrates how ColorSchemes can be applied by disabling AeroTheme on Office2007Form.

{% highlight C# %}

// Disables Aero Theme on Office2007Form.

this. ApplyAeroTheme = false;

{% endhighlight %}
 
{% highlight vbnet %}

â€˜Disables Aero Theme on Office2007Form.

Me. ApplyAeroTheme = false;

{% endhighlight %}
