# BorderLayout

BorderLayout is a Layout Manager which allows the user to arrange and layout the Child controls along the borders and at the center, just like the .NET framework's built-in docking support.

> Note: BorderLayout does not arrange the Child components automatically like the other Layout Managers.

A sample which demonstrates the BorderLayout is available in the below sample installation path.
