# GroupView

The GroupView control implements a selectable list that can display a collection of items, where each item is represented by an 
image and a descriptor.

The GroupView control's appearance and behavior attributes are extensively customizable, making it possible to create a wide range
of interfaces such as lists with large / small images, regular / flow view, button type selection, flat look and selective item 
highlighting / underlining.
