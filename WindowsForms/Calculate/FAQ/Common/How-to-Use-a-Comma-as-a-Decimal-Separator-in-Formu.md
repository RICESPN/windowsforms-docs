# How to Use a Comma as a Decimal Separator in Formula?

Local settings may require the use of a different decimal separator than the period character that Essential Calculate uses by default. For example, many Local settings use a comma as the decimal separator.

To manage this problem, Essential Calculate exposes two static (Shared in VB.NET) members, which, you can set to specify the character that is recognized as the decimal separator and the character that is recognized as the list separator. The default values of these members are a period and a comma,respectively. You can set these static members at any point in your code before you use any Essential Calculate objects.
