# How to give flat look to the parent form of TileLayout?

We can give the Flat look to the parent form by using the property named [SetParentFormFlat](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TileLayout.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Forms_Tools_TileLayout_SetParentFormFlat).

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

//Enables flat look for parent form

this.tileLayout1.SetParentFormFlat = true;

{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight VB %}

'Enables flat look for parent form

Me.tileLayout1.SetParentFormFlat = True
 
{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}
