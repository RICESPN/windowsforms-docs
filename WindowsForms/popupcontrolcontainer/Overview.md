# Overview

A PopupControlContainer is a panel-derived control that allows end-users to populate it with child controls and finally associate the same with a parent control. By default, it’s hidden, and it can be brought into existence when performing events like mouse-down, mouse-up, etc… over the parent control. 

## Key Features

* **Auto Scroll** - Scrollbar will be automatically shown when its items are populated beyond its default size.

* **Auto Close** - The pop-up will be hidden when user clicks anywhere outside the container.

* **Keyboard Navigation** - By using keyboard dialog keys like Enter, Tab, Esc, etc... we can close the popup.

* **RTL** - RTL is used to display the content from right to left.
