# Navigation in Windows Forms Calendar (SfCalendar)

By default, the calendar displays the month view. You can move from current month to previous or next month in the calendar control by clicking navigation buttons in the header, and also you can move from month view to other views (year, decade, century) to select the dates from other year or decade by click the header text of the calendar.

## Different views 

Calendar supports month, year, decade, and century views and provides intuitive interface through which you can navigate and quickly select dates.

You can choose the required view options in the calendar by the [ViewMode](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.SfCalendar.html#Syncfusion_WinForms_Input_SfCalendar_ViewMode) property. The following code illustrates how to show year and decade views in the calendar.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

// setting Year and decade mode to display year and decade view
    
calendar.ViewMode = Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.Enums.CalendarViewType.Year | Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.Enums.CalendarViewType.Decade;

{% endhighlight  %}

{% highlight VB %}

' setting Year and decade mode to display year and decade view

calendar.ViewMode = Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.Enums.CalendarViewType.Year Or Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.Enums.CalendarViewType.Decade

{% endhighlight  %}

{% endtabs %}

## Navigation through mouse

The navigation between next or previous range of dates for the current view in the calendar can be done by clicking up and down navigation buttons in the calendar header. The `SfCalendar` control allows you to navigate from one view to other view by clicking the header text of the calendar and selecting the cell from the view to navigate back to the next available view in the `ViewMode`.

## Navigation through keyboard

The `SfCalendar` control allows you to navigate from one view to other view by pressing the `CTRL + UP` keys in backward direction or `CTRL + DOWN` keys in forward direction. The SfCalendar allows you to navigate between different cells in the same view by pressing navigation arrows. `CTRL + LEFT` and `CTRL + RIGHT` arrow keys are pressed to navigate to previous or next month of the calendar respectively.

## Navigation through touch

The navigation between next or previous range of dates for the current view in the calendar can be done by panning on the calendar view. The `SfCalendar` control allows you to navigate from one view to other view by tapping the header of the calendar. Tapping the cell in view navigates back to the next available view in the `ViewMode`.

## Handle view change

The [ViewChanging](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.SfCalendar.html) event occurs when the calendar header text is clicked to change the view from one view to another view. The change of view can be restricted on-demand by handling the [ViewChanging](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.SfCalendar.html) event. The `ViewChangingEventArgs` provides information about the old and new `ViewType`. This helps to restrict the view change in specific scenarios only. The following code example illustrates the same:

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

// Invoked when the view changed.

 calendar.ViewChanging += SfCalendar_ViewChanging;  

  private void SfCalendar_ViewChanging(Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.SfCalendar sender, Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.Events.ViewChangingEventArgs args)
  
  {

      if(args.NewViewType == Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.Enums.CalendarViewType.Year)

      {

         args.Cancel = true;

      }

  }

{% endhighlight  %}

{% highlight VB %}

' Invoked when the view changed.

calendar.ViewChanging += SfCalendar_ViewChanging

    Private Sub SfCalendar_ViewChanging(ByVal sender As 
    Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.SfCalendar, ByVal args As Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.Events.ViewChangingEventArgs)
      
        If (args.NewViewType = Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.Enums.CalendarViewType.Year) Then
      
            args.Cancel = true
      
        End If
        
    End Sub

{% endhighlight  %}

{% endtabs %}


## Handle navigation

The [Navigating](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.SfCalendar.html) event occurs when navigating between current range of dates to next or previous range of dates in the calendar. The navigation between the same views can be restricted by handling the [Navigating](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.SfCalendar.html) event. The `NavigatingEventArgs` provides information about the old and new ranges of dates. This helps to restrict navigation in specific scenarios only. The following code example illustrates the same:

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

// Invoked the Navigating event.

this.sfCalendar.Navigating += SfCalendar_Navigating;

private void SfCalendar_Navigating(SfCalendar sender, Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.Events.NavigatingEventArgs args)

{

    if (args.NewValue.Start <= new DateTime(2018, 04, 01) && args.NewValue.End >= new DateTime(2018, 04, 30))

    {

        args.Cancel = true;

    }

}

{% endhighlight  %}

{% highlight VB %}

' Invoked the Navigating event.

Me.sfCalendar.Navigating = (Me.sfCalendar.Navigating + SfCalendar_Navigating)
    
    Private Sub SfCalendar_Navigating(ByVal sender As SfCalendar, ByVal args As Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.Events.NavigatingEventArgs)

        If ((args.NewValue.Start <= New DateTime(2018, 4, 1))  _

                    AndAlso (args.NewValue.End >= New DateTime(2018, 4, 30))) Then

            args.Cancel = true

        End If
        
End Sub

{% endhighlight  %}

{% endtabs %}

## Disable animation on navigation

The SfCalendar animates the content while navigating between different sets of date ranges or move from one view to another view. This animation can be disabled by setting the [EnableAnimation](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/windowsforms/Syncfusion.WinForms.Input.SfCalendar.html#Syncfusion_WinForms_Input_SfCalendar_EnableAnimation) to false. The following code example illustrates the same:

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

// Disabling the animation

calendar.EnableAnimation = false;

{% endhighlight  %}

{% highlight VB %}

' Disabling the animation

calendar.EnableAnimation = False

{% endhighlight  %}

{% endtabs %}
