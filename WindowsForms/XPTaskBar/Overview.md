# Overview

The XPTaskBar control simulates the new TaskBar feature popularized in Windows XP. The XPTaskBar is the encompassing control that 
can show one or more XPTaskBar Boxes. Each Box can in turn show user click able command items represented by the XPTaskBar Item 
type. The box can also take a single child panel inside which you can drop any custom control. It also provides keyboard 
navigational support.

Popularized in XP, this look-and-feel can be the exact theme look when this control is ThemesEnabled. This control, however, can 
be used in any Operating System where it falls back to some specified color settings. The boxes are also collapsible, just like 
in XP. 

You can then add one or more XPTaskBar Items to the boxes using their Items property. 

The following screen shot illustrates the XPTaskBar and it's elements.
