# Getting Started

Tree maps are a growing trend in data visualization. They display hierarchical information in a series of clustered rectangles, which together represent a whole. The size of each box represents a quantity. Tree maps can also use color to represent any number of values, but colors are often used to categorize the various boxes within the tree map.

Creating Tree Map for Windows Form Applications

The TreeMap control is available in the following assembly and namespace:

Assembly: Syncfusion.TreeMap.Windows

Namespace: Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.TreeMap

Refer to the following code to add a TreeMap control to an application:

#### Code Sample

{% highlight c# %}

TreeMap TreeMap1 = new TreeMap();

{% endhighlight %}
