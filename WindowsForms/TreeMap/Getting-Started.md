# Getting Started

Tree maps are a growing trend in data visualization. They display hierarchical information in a series of clustered rectangles, which represent a whole rectangle. The size of each box represents a quantity. Tree maps can also use color to represent any number of values, but colors are often used to categorize the various boxes within the tree map.

## Creating tree map for Windows Forms applications

The tree map control is available in the following assembly and namespace:

Assembly: Syncfusion.TreeMap.Windows

Namespace: Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.TreeMap

Refer to the following code to add a tree map control to an application.


{% tabs %}

{% highlight c# %}

TreeMap TreeMap1 = new TreeMap();

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}
