# Overview

The SplashControl provides an easy way to use classes that can be used to display splash screens. The SplashControl can be dragged and dropped onto your form from the controls toolbox. The SplashControl is implemented as a component that is not visible at run time. It is visible in the component area of your form where you can select it and set it's properties.
