# Overview

The `SplashControl` is a control that makes creating a splash screen easy. You just drag and drop a SplashControl onto your main form and set the image for splash screen. The splash screen will be automatically displayed at run time. The timing, and look feel of the splash control can be modified through the designer itself.
