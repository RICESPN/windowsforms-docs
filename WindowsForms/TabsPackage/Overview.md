The XP Tabs (TabControlAdv) feature provided as part of this package is an advanced TabControl with plenty of appearance styles and configuration capabilities. It makes the creation of custom tabs with custom shapes and styles a snap.

Resembling the class names in the framework, the TabControlAdv and TabPageAdv classes represent the TabControl and the TabPages of the XP Tabs Package. Users can parent one or more tabpages to a tabcontrol which lets them switch between these tabpages via a TabStrip (which is also referred as a TabPanel). The TabPages in turn are panel-derived classes that let users host ChildControls within them. 

The TabControlAdv and the TabPageAdv controls come with full design-time support.

## Features Overview

The Tabs framework contains the TabControlAdv with a full set of features to support efficient tab usage to create rich user applications.

## TabControlAdv

TabControlAdv in Toolbox

TabControlAdv is a control in the Tabs Package that manages a set of TabPages and provides options to customize the TabPages according to the needs of the user.

The TabControlAdv automatically adds pages to every tabitem being added to the application with uniform dimensions for all the pages.

### TabPanels

TabPanels are used to switch between the various tab pages / tab items in the TabControlAdv.

### TabItems

TabItems are items added to the TabControlAdv by default when a tabpage is added. Unlike the usual items, the tabitems when clicked, provide access to the respective tabpages and does not contain any event to hold the user written code.

### TabPages

TabPages are the pages included in the TabControl. The TabPages are laid one above the other and only a single tabpage can be viewed at a time. Each page acts as a ContainerControl and can host ChildControls within it using the TabPageAdv panel-derived class.

 The TabPageAdv can be added to the TabControlAdv through designer as well as through code.

### Through Code

To create a TabControlAdv programmatically,

1. Add the Syncfusion assembly Tools.Windows to your application.
2. Add the namespace Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.

   ~~~ cs

		using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools;

   ~~~
   {:.prettyprint }

   ~~~ vbnet

	Imports Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools

   ~~~
   {:.prettyprint }


3. Declare the TabControlAdv and TabPageAdv.

   ~~~ cs



		private Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TabControlAdv tabControlAdv1;

		private Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TabPageAdv tabPageAdv1;

		private Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TabPageAdv tabPageAdv2;

		private Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TabPageAdv tabPageAdv3;

   ~~~
   {:.prettyprint } 

   ~~~ vbnet

		Private tabControlAdv1 As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TabControlAdv

		Private tabPageAdv1 As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TabPageAdv

		Private tabPageAdv2 As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TabPageAdv

		Private tabPageAdv3 As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TabPageAdv

   ~~~
   {:.prettyprint }

4. The following code creates a TabControlAdv with three tabpages.

   ~~~ cs



		private void Form1_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)

		{

			//Initialize the tabControlAdv and tabPageAdv

			this.tabControlAdv1 = new TabControlAdv();

			this.tabPageAdv1 = new TabPageAdv();

			this.tabPageAdv2 = new TabPageAdv();

			this.tabPageAdv3 = new TabPageAdv();





			//Add the TabPageAdv to the TabControlAdv.

			this.tabControlAdv1.Controls.AddRange(new Control[]{this.tabPageAdv1, this.tabPageAdv2, this.tabPageAdv3});



			//Set the location of the TabContolAdv

			this.tabControlAdv1.Location = new Point(16, 24);



			//Set the text of the TabPageAdv

			this.tabPageAdv1.Text = "Tab1";

			this.tabPageAdv2.Text = "Tab2";

			this.tabPageAdv3.Text = "Tab3";



			//Add the TabControlAdv to your form                

			this.Controls.AddRange(new Control[] { this.tabControlAdv1});

		}


   ~~~
   {:.prettyprint }
   
   ~~~ vbnet



		Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load



			'Initialize the tabControlAdv and tabPageAdv

			Me.tabControlAdv1 = New TabControlAdv()

			Me.tabPageAdv1 = New TabPageAdv()

			Me.tabPageAdv2 = New TabPageAdv()

			Me.tabPageAdv3 = New TabPageAdv()



			'Add the TabPageAdv to the TabControlAdv.

			Me.tabControlAdv1.Controls.AddRange(New Control() {Me.tabPageAdv1, Me.tabPageAdv2, Me.tabPageAdv3})



			'Set the location of the TabContolAdv

			Me.tabControlAdv1.Location = New Point(16, 24)



			'Set the text of the TabPageAdv

			Me.tabPageAdv1.Text = "Tab1"

			Me.tabPageAdv2.Text = "Tab2"

			Me.tabPageAdv3.Text = "Tab3"



			'Add the TabControlAdv to your form                

			Me.Controls.AddRange(New Control() {Me.tabControlAdv1})

		End Sub
