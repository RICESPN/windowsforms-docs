## Introduction to Essential Chart

EssentialChart is an easily configurable, presentation quality business chart control. A unique point based Styles Architecture, easily extendable Data Model, easily extendable rendering model, native Date Handling and a unique Shared Data Model are the features that distinguish Essential chart. This control has been created using C#, which means that it is a fully-managed .NET component, and  has been specifically designed for use with Microsoft's Visual Studio .NET.

EssentialChart for Windows Forms is a perfect solution for developers looking to add advanced, feature rich, visually appealing charts to their Windows Forms applications. The product comes with numerous samples as well as an extensive documentation to guide you every step of the way. 

Chart is used as a means to show the graphical representation of two values. For Example, a Line Chart can be used in health Statistic reports, in which it can show the rates over time or for a series of values, such as age-specific death rates. Logarithmic charts can be used in Share price charts where we plot between price and time. In logarithmic chart, we can identify the 'Proportional change in price' with respect to the 'Change in time'. We use 'Proportional change in price' to observe market sentiment. Market participants move share prices either up or down proportionally depending on how bullish or bearish they feel.
