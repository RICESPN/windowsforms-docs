# Overview

ProgressBars are used in applications to provide a visual cue during lengthy operations such as installation, copying, and printing. It also lets users know the time remaining to complete a lengthy operation. When an application is performing a lengthy task in the background, users may not be sure if the application is still working. A ProgressBar can be used to provide a visual cue that the application is indeed working and the task is being completed.
