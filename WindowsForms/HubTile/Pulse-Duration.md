# Pulse Duration

In PulsingTile, the time interval between Zoom In and Zoom Out operations can be modified using PulseDuration property. It decreases on increasing the value to this property and vice-versa.

The following code example shows how to set the Pulse duration.



{% highlight C# %}  

this.HubTile1.PulseDuration = 2;

{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight vbnet %} 

Me.HubTile1.PulseDuration = 2

{% endhighlight %}
