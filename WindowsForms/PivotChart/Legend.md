# Legend

PivotChart, by default, displays a Legend with information on each series that has been plotted on the chart. LegendÂ is a color code that helps differentiate between chart items. Legend also has labels beside each color to indicate that it applies to information from Series 1, Series 2, and so on. Legend is made visible in PivotChart by using the property ShowLegend.

{% highlight c# %}


this.pivotChart1.ShowLegend = true; 

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vbnet %}

Me.pivotChart1.ShowLegend = True 

{% endhighlight %}


The Legends have integral floating support and can be placed anywhere in the chart area as per your requirements.

{% highlight c# %}


this.pivotChart1.LegendPosition = Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Chart.ChartDock.Floating;

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vbnet %}

Me.pivotChart1.LegendPosition = Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Chart.ChartDock.Floating

{% endhighlight %}

The Legend alignment can be marked within the ChartArea by using the LegendAlignment enumeration.

{% highlight c# %}

this.pivotChart1.LegendAlignment = Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Chart.ChartAlignment.Center;


{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vbnet %}

Me.pivotChart1.LegendAlignment = Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Chart.ChartAlignment.Center

{% endhighlight %}

The legend positioning can be affected in the following ways.
