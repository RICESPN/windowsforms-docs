# Drill Up/Down Level

Through expanders, you can drill down to the next level of hierarchy and drill up to the previous level. The PivotChart has built-in support to drill up and down the PivotSeries population. This behavior can be achieved by enabling the AllowDrillDown property.

{% highlight c# %}

this.pivotChart1.AllowDrillDown = true;

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vbnet %}

Me.pivotChart1.AllowDrillDown = True

{% endhighlight %}
