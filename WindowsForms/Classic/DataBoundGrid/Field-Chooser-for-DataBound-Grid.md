Adding Field Chooser for GridDataBoundGrid

   The following code illustrates this:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
GridDataBoundFieldChooser fChooser = new GridDataBoundFieldChooser();
fChooser.WireGrid(this.GridDataBoundGrid1);
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vb %}
Dim fChooser As GridDataBoundFieldChooser = New GridDataBoundFieldChooser()
fChooser.WireGrid(Me.GridDataBoundGrid1)
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}



2. When the code runs, the entire grid will open.
3. Right click on a column header and select the Field Chooser menu item to view _Field Chooser_ dialog.
