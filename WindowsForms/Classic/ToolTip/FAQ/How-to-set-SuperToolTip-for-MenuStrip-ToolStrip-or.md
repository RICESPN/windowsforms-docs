# SuperToolTip for MenuStrip, ToolStrip and etc in Windows Forms

Few Controls like MenuStrip, ToolStrip or ToolStripEx and RibbonTabControl already have the feature of showing Tooltip. 

To set the SuperToolTip for such controls, set their ShowItemToolTips property to false and then configure the SuperToolTip for those controls.
