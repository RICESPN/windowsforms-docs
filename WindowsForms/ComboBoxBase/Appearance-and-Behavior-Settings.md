# Appearance and Behavior Settings in Windows Forms ComboBoxBase

This section includes the discussion of Appearance and Behavior Settings of ComboBoxBase.

The ComboBoxBase control provides Style, FlatStyle and other properties to enable advanced border drawing features. Written using native .NET Controls, this control lets you customize everything in the combo box from the text box to the drop-down window. Refer [ComboBoxAdv](/windowsforms/ComboBoxAdv) user guide, which contains properties included in ComboBoxBase.

You will also notice that some of the properties you can find in the Framework combo box (like IntegralHeight, ItemHeight, MaxDropDownItems, datasource and events like SelectedIndexChanged) are missing in the ComboBoxBase. These properties and events are meant to be set / handled in the plugged-in ListControl.
