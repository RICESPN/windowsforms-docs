# How to give flat look to the parent form of TileLayout?

We can give the Flat look to the parent form by using the property named SetParentFormFlat.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

//Enables flat look for parent form

this.tileLayout1.SetParentFormFlat = true;

{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight VB %}

'Enables flat look for parent form

Me.tileLayout1.SetParentFormFlat = True
 
{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}
