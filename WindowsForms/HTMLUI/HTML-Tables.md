# HTML tables

HTMLUI has a rich table support that lets the user to decide the table's dimensions and design. The HTMLUI table support also comes with different alignments of text within the table. This helps the user in creating advanced and highly structured HTML applications.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight HTML %}

<html>

<body>

<table>

<tr><td>Table support in HTMLUI</td></tr>

</table>

</body>

</html>

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

The HTML document that defines the Tables is then loaded into HTMLUI using any of the ways discussed in the section [Loading HTML](/windowsforms/htmlui/loading-html).
