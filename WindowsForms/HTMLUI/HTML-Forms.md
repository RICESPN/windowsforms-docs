# HTML Forms

Forms are the containers for placing the elements in a HTML document. HTMLUI supports the usage of forms for developing advanced and decorative pages in the user's application. 

{% highlight html %}

<html>

<body>

<form>

<input type = "text"/><br/>

<input type = "button"/><br/>

<input type = "checkbox" checked /><br/>

</form>

</body>

</html>

{% endhighlight %}

Loading the above HTML document into HTMLUI creates a Form with the three controls specified as shown below.
