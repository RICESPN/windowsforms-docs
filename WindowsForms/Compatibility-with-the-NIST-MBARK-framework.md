## Compatibility with the NIST MBARK framework
Syncfusion components are compatible with the `NIST MBARK` framework applications. [NIST’s MBARK](https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/multimodal-biometric-application-resource-kit-mbark) is public domain source code that may be leveraged to develop the next generation of biometric and personal identity verification applications. `NIST MBARK` application is based on .NET 3.5 SP1 framework and latest .NET framework versions. Incorporating the `MBARK` libraries can yield a variety of enhancements critical for the success of any real-world system.

`NIST’s MBARK` is originally envisioned as a tool to develop a large database of face, fingerprint and iris images for performance testing of biometric systems. `MBARK` has evolved into a standardized, flexible middle ware package that will enable organizations to plug in sensors from different manufacturers.
