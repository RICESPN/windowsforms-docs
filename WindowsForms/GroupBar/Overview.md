# Overview

The GroupBar and GroupView controls abide by the container-client model and are designed to work in perfect synchronization with each other.

The GroupBar class implements a tab-type container control similar to the Windows Forms TabControl that can serve as a host for other Windows Forms controls. Each control in the GroupBar is represented by a GroupBarItem and navigation between the different controls is accomplished by selecting the corresponding GroupBarItem. Only the selected control is displayed at any particular time.

## Key Features

* **Text Settings**: Provides options to align the text of the GroupBarItems to the Left , Right, or Center. GroupBar control provides options for renaming the GroupBarItems at run-time. 

* **Image settings**: Provides options to display Large images or Icons on the header of the GroupBar as well as Stacked GroupBar.

* **Header Customization**: Provides complete customization support to the header such as colors font and height of the header text of the GroupBarItems.

* **Stacked GroupBar**: Provides options to display GroupBarItems in a Stack like fashion. Stacked GroupBar provides a Navigation Pane that can be viewed at the bottom of the Groupbar.

* **Nested GroupBar**: A GroupBar Control can be added as a Child control to another GroupBar Control. In fact any .NET control can be hosted in a GroupBar for maximum flexibility. Thus the GroupBar control can be deployed as a Generic Control Container.

* **Visual Styles** : Provides option to customize the appearance using rich set of available built-in visual styles.

* **Serialization Support**: Serialization allows the user to save and restore the State information of the GroupBarItems when a GroupBar is in the Stacked Mode.
