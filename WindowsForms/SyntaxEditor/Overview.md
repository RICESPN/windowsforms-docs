# Overview

`Edit Control` is a powerful text editor control to create interactive code editor applications with its unique feature set. It has many efficient features like editing, syntax highlighting, text indentation, intellisense, expand or collapse a block of code, custom language configuration etc., as like in Microsoft Visual Studio Editor.

## Key Features 

Some of the key features are listed below.

* **Editing support** - Allows the end users to modify, edit text documents and source code files. This includes clipboard support, Unlimited undo and redo, Drag and Drop, Block Indent and Outdent and so on.
* **File Support** - Supports all file operations like create new, open or save files.
* **Syntax highlighting** - Provides a built-in syntax highlighting and code editing experience in the most popular languages like C#, VB, SQL, XML etc., Essential Edit offers fully configurable syntax highlighting for general text editing purposes. Syntax highlighting greatly improves the readability of any text and has found its way into many commercial applications. 
* **Custom Language Support** - Support for user defined language configurations. Custom language configurations can be created easily and applied to the content in the edit control.
* **Word Wrap** - Provides extensive wrapping support in Edit Control. 
* **Line Number Support** - Line numbers for the text in the edit control can be displayed for easy reference with the ability to enable or disable this feature.
* **Code Outlining** - Sections of code which form the outlining blocks can be specified using the Configuration Settings. Edit control defines different brackets for highlighting different languages.
* **Printing and Exporting** - Interactive support to print and export the content and its syntax highlighting information to XML, RFT and HTML.
* **Outlining ToolTip** - Provides interactive ToolTip support, which is built-in and appears automatically when the mouse pointer is placed over the collapsed block of text.
* **Expand or Collapse** - Support for collapsing and expanding blocks of code using Collapsers (plus-minus buttons).

* **Scrollbar** - Provides multiple scrollbar visibility settings.

* **Single-Line Edit Mode** - Supports a single-line mode that renders just like a regular TextBox. This enables you to have a simple TextBox but with all the syntax-highlighting, selection, IntelliPrompt and other features that make SyntaxEditor great for editing code.
* **Status Bar** - Provide built-in status bar at the bottom of the control with different panels that display different information. It helps to track the line number, column number and char number of the caret. 
* **Scrolling** - Provides extremely a smooth scrolling behavior even when large files are loaded in Edit Control, it scrolls several hundred lines within fraction of moment.

* **Bookmark and Custom Indicators** - Support to locate a section or a line of a document by using the Bookmarks and Custom Indicators feature like in Visual Studio. There are no limitations for the number of user indicators that can be displayed in the indicator margin. This provides quick access to any part of the contents of the Edit Control.
