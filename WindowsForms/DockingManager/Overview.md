# Overview

The `DockingManager` control implements an architecture that allows panels to be docked at any part of form. The dock panels containing the child elements can be interactively dragged to any area within screen and also can be resized at run time. Panels can be docked to form edges or each other panels. Dock panels can also be floated, tabbed, and auto hidden.
