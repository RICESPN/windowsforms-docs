## SplashControl

The SplashControl is a control that makes creating a splash screen easy. You just drag and drop a SplashControl onto your main form and set the image for the splash screen and the splash screen will be automatically displayed at run time. The timing, and look and feel of the SplashControl can be modified through the designer itself.
