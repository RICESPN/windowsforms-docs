# How to Set the Number of Rows or Columns

## Introduction

Dynamically changing the RowCount or ColCount properties while a GridControl is being displayed is an efficient way to add or remove rows and/or columns from a GridControl. Using the designer, set gridâ€™s RowCount and ColCount properties. From code, set these properties after the call to InitializeComponent in the form's constructor (or anytime later in your code after the GridControl has been created). 

### Example

{% highlight c# %}



public Form1()

{

        //

        //Requires for Windows Form Designer support.

        //

        InitializeComponent();



        //

        //TODO: Add any constructor code after InitializeComponent call.

        //



        //Sets the number of rows.             

        gridControl1.RowCount = 20;



        //Sets the number of columns.    

        gridControl1.ColCount = 200;

}


{% endhighlight  %}
{% highlight vbnet %}



  Public Sub New()

        MyBase.New()



'This call is required by the Windows Form Designer.

        InitializeComponent()



'Adds any initialization after the InitializeComponent() call.



'Sets the number of rows.             

        GridControl1.RowCount = 20 



'Sets the number of columns.    

        GridControl1.ColCount = 200 

    End Sub

{% endhighlight  %}
